                            <p>After World War II, Japan's top national priority was to rebuild the economy. What came out of the shift was a work culture where young men, later, women are given lifelong job security in exchange for their loyalty. The salaryman culture promised stability, social acceptance and praises for the workers' unyielding resolve to ultimately contribute to the nation's economic growth through devotion to their employer.</p>
                            <blockquote>"I don't want my manager to be saying anything bad about me because I took the day off. It is easier to just work rather than them saying bad things about me or being told off"</blockquote>
                            <p>For many Japanese employees, taking more than the bare minimum of vacation time is just not an option.</p>
                            <p>Hideyuki who has two children aged six and four and is hesitant to disclose his full name owing to probably penalties at work says, "it's tough since the environment in the workplace wouldn't allow it. Last year, the 33-year-old engineer, who works for a technology firm in Tokyo, had only two days off. It's not that he couldn't take any more, in fact, he is entitled to 20 days of annual leave.</p>
