                            <p>After World War II, Japan's top national priority was to rebuild the economy. What came out of the shift was a work culture where young men, later, women are given lifelong job security in exchange for their loyalty. The salaryman culture promised stability, social acceptance and praises for the workers' unyielding resolve to ultimately contribute to the nation's economic growth through devotion to their employer.</p>
                            <p>Karoshi, which can be translated literally as "overwork death", is a Japanese term relating to occupational sudden death. The most common causes of karoshi deaths are heart attacks, strokes due to stress, starvation diet but it also includes suicide due to mental fatigue and depression caused by prolonged periods burnouts from a toxic social pressure and working environment.</p>
                            <blockquote>"I don't want my manager to be saying anything bad about me because I took the day off. It is easier to just work rather than them saying bad things about me or being told off"</blockquote>
                            <p>For many Japanese employees, taking more than the bare minimum of vacation time is just not an option. The salaryman culture is so closely tied to the East Asian culture's value of placing importance on the fulfillment of the needs of the collective over the individuals' that self-serving behaviors, even as a mean to an individuals' preservation of health are stigmatized</p>
                            <p>Hideyuki who has two children aged six and four and is hesitant to disclose his full name owing to probably penalties at work says, "it's tough since the environment in the workplace wouldn't allow it. Last year, the 33-year-old engineer, who works for a technology firm in Tokyo, had only two days off. It's not that he couldn't take any more, in fact, he is entitled to 20 days of annual leave.</p>
